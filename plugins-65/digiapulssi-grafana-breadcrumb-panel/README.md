# Breadcrumb Panel Plugin for Grafana
This is a panel plugin for [Grafana](http://grafana.org/). It keeps track of dashboards you have visited within one session
and displays them as a breadcrumb. Each dashboard is added only once to the breadcrumb. You can navigate back to some
dashboard in breadcrumb by clicking the dashboard name link text. When navigation back all items coming after the selected
dashboard will be removed from the breadcrumb. Note that breadcrumb can track only dashboards that have breadcrumb panel on them.

To understand what is a plugin, read the [Grafana's documentation about plugins](http://docs.grafana.org/plugins/development/).
